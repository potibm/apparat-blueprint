# Apparat Blueprint

## OIDC Authentication

Apparat Blueprint supports OIDC-based authentication for the admin panel. The backend validates JWT Bearer tokens against any configurable OIDC provider (the bundled Dex instance locally, your own IdP in production), and the React Admin frontend handles the login flow via `oidc-client-ts`.

### Configuration

Authentication is configured via the `auth` section in `backend/config/config.yaml` (or environment variables):

```yaml
auth:
  type: "oidc"
  name: "Dex"
  authority: "https://dex.apparat-blueprint.test/dex"
  client_id: "react-admin-client"
  skip_tls_verify: false
```

| Key | Environment Variable | Description |
|-----|---------------------|-------------|
| `auth.type` | `AUTH_TYPE` | Authentication type. Currently only `oidc` is supported. |
| `auth.name` | `AUTH_NAME` | Display name of the Identity Provider (shown on the login button). |
| `auth.authority` | `AUTH_AUTHORITY` | OIDC Issuer URL (must expose `/.well-known/openid-configuration`). |
| `auth.client_id` | `AUTH_CLIENT_ID` | OIDC Client ID registered with the provider. |
| `auth.skip_tls_verify` | `AUTH_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY` | **Development only.** Disables TLS certificate verification for the OIDC discovery endpoint. Must be `false` in production. |

### Authentication Flow

1. **Frontend**: When `auth.type` is `oidc`, the admin app bootstraps a `UserManager` from `oidc-client-ts` using the authority and client ID from `/api/config`.
2. **Login**: The user clicks "Login with {Name}" on the custom login page. This triggers `signinRedirect()` to the OIDC provider.
3. **Callback**: After successful authentication, the provider redirects back to the app root (`https://apparat-blueprint.test/?code=...`). React Admin's login page detects the `code` parameter and `authProvider.handleCallback()` exchanges it for tokens. There is deliberately **no** separate `/auth-callback` route — the redirect URI is the origin root.
4. **API Calls**: The `dataProvider` automatically attaches the access token as a `Bearer` header to every `/api/admin` request.
5. **Backend Validation**: The `AuthMiddleware` verifies the JWT signature and issuer against the configured OIDC provider. Valid tokens inject the `userID` into the Gin context and GORM request context.
6. **Audit Trail**: The GORM audit callbacks automatically populate `created_by`, `modified_by`, and `deleted_by` fields on all models that embed `AuditModel`.

### Default Local Credentials

The bundled Dex instance ships with a static development user so the login loop works out of the
box after `mise run infra:up`:

- **Email**: `admin@example.com`
- **Password**: `password`
- **User ID**: `08a8684b-db88-4b73-90a9-3cd1661f5466`

> **DEV ONLY.** This is a well-known development default, not a secret. Never carry it into a
> deployed environment — replace `enablePasswordDB` in `infra/dex-config.yaml` with a real
> connector, or point `auth.authority` at your own IdP.

### Disabling Authentication

To run the admin panel without authentication (not recommended for production), omit the `auth` section from the configuration entirely. The frontend will then skip OIDC bootstrapping and the backend will not enforce Bearer token validation on `/api/admin` routes.
